# Face Recognition Attendance System

<p><em><strong>Face recognition</strong></em> is a method of identifying or verifying a person's identity using their face. Face recognition systems can be used to identify people in photos, videos or in real-time.<br>
In this project, we verify or identify a person through real time so that a person can mark his presence efficiently.</p>
